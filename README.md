# StableDiffusion-By-Parts
Slice and dice the Stable Diffusion pipeline, saving to a TIFF file in between sections.

This is prototype code, so it has hard-coded values and requires manual love to use it for anything other than testing. A Huggingface account is required at this stage, unless you change that part of the code yourself, which is fine. 

TODO:
-----
1.) remove dependencies on diffusers
2.) more/better input params
3.) add support for .ckpt files and other similar bits
